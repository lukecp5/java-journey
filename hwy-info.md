You can use the modulus operator (%) to compute the reminder of an integer division operation.

For example: 290 % 100 will evaluate to 90, because the remainder after dividing 290 by 100 is 90.

As another example: 185 % 2 is 1, because 2 goes into 185, 92 times with 1 left over. Also, note that for any integer x, x % 2 will always evaluate to 1 when x is odd, and it will always evaluate to 0 when x is even.

Example 2:

Enter the highway number : 290

The 290 is auxiliary, serving the 90, going east/west.
Example 3:

Enter the highway number : 185

The 185 is auxiliary, serving the 85, going north/south.
